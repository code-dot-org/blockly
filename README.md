[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/code-dot-org/blockly.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/code-dot-org/blockly)

This is a fork of [Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/), an open source visual programming environment.

Major additions and changes in this fork:

* Modal editor for function blocks ([function_editor.js](./core/ui/function_editor.js)) 
* Scrolling improvements:
  * auto-scroll on block drag ([scroll_on_block_drag_handler.js](./core/ui/block_space/scroll_on_block_drag_handler.js))
  * scroll on mouse wheel ([scroll_on_wheel_handler.js](./core/ui/block_space/scroll_on_wheel_handler.js))
* New in-toolbox trashcan
* Addition of "Functional blocks" and "Contract/Variable Editor" ([contract_editor/](./core/ui/contract_editor/)) for use in the CS in Algebra curriculum
  * Blocks have "Block Value Types" ([block_value_type.js](./core/utils/block_value_type.js))
* Support for "block limits" ([block_limits.js](./core/ui/block_space/block_limits.js)), toolbox blocks which allow only a certain number of instances in the block space
* Support for new block properties ([block.js](./core/ui/block.js)): invisible, un-deletable, immovable, specify-able via a context menu when `Blockly.editBlocks` is set
* Structure: add folders in [core/](./core) to further categorize classes
* New field types:
  * Image Dropdown ([field_image_dropdown.js](./core/ui/fields/field_image_dropdown.js))
* BlockSpace (Workspace) Refactoring:
  * moved many static properties and methods from `blockly.js` into a prototype class `BlockSpaceEditor` which can be instantiated multiple times on the same page
  * renamed `Workspace` to `BlockSpace` to disambiguate from higher-level `BlockSpaceEditor`
  * improved support for multiple blockspaces on a single page
* Playground: add dependency cache and generation script ([tests/update_test_dependencies.sh](./tests/update_test_dependencies.sh)), to allow for testing changes without re-building
  * support for [goog.ui.tweak](https://google.github.io/closure-library/source/closure/goog/demos/tweakui.html)s to configure playground page behavior
  * debug drawing helpers for block bumping 
* Support for a special UI for unattached blocks
* Improvements to block arrangement on initialization
* Testing: add phantomjs-based test runner [test.sh](./test.sh). Tested in CI at root level of this repository.

## Installation

1. Download and install JDK version 8 from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
2. run the following commands:

```
cd blockly
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Playground manual testing page

There is a playground manual testing page at [tests/playground.html](./tests/playground.html), which requires no build step or server running.

`open tests/playground.html`

### Building with apps

This is the most typical use case for code-dot-org fork development.

[Apps (aka Code Studio)](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/tree/staging/apps) is a set of blockly apps built on top of blockly, which installs and references this package via NPM. The easiest pathway for local development is to use [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link):

```
cd {blockly repo directory}
npm link
cd {code-dot-org repo directory}/apps
npm link @code-dot-org/blockly
```

Apps will now reference your local blockly repository rather than the npm package. If you then make local changes to your repo, you can simply rebuild blockly (via `npm run build` in this repo) and then apps (via `npm run build` in code-dot-org/apps) to communicate those changes to apps.

### Publishing changes

To publish a new version to npm switch to the master branch, use `npm login` to sign in as an account with access to the `@code-dot-org` scope, then `npm version [major|minor|patch|premajor|preminor|prepatch]` for the appropriate version bump.  This will do the following:

* Run linting and tests to verify your local repo.
* Rebuild the release package.
* Bump the version, adding a corresponding commit and version tag.
* Push the commit and tag to github.
* Publish the new release package to npm.

#### Testing changes

There are a set of utility and integration tests included in `tests/blockly_test.html`, and a playground manual testing page at `tests/playground.html`.

After adding any new files, you will need to run `./update_test_dependencies.sh` to update the test dependency map, which caches file dependencies so edits can be tested and played with without any re-build time.

There are three ways the test suites can be run:

1. `./test.sh` will run the tests in phantomjs
1. To debug failures, you can open the test page in your browser, e.g. `open tests/blockly_test.html` 
1. `./deploy.sh` will also run `./test.sh` at the end of its full rebuild.

##### Other tests covering this package

[Blockly apps](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/tree/staging/apps) contains many tests that target features of blockly in the context of the code.org curriculum apps.

Additionally, [Dashboard's UI tests](https://github.com/code-dot-org/code-dot-org/tree/staging/dashboard/test/ui) cover certain features of blockly through Cucumber / Selenium scenarios.
